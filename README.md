## Contribution Guidelines

At the present time, I have locked the spreadsheet to prevent anyone from creating incorrect copies. If there is enough interest in improving the spreadsheet further, I will release an unlocked copy.

If you decide to fork this yourself, I request that you adhere to the following:

 1. Provide a link to [this git page][gitrepo] as attribution.
 2. Release your fork under the same license ([CC-BY-SA][CC-BY-SA-full-web]).
 3. Properly maintain your fork to keep it up-to-date with the Clash of Clans game.
 4. Issue a git pull request to merge your improvements into my version.
    a. Please include a detailed description of your changes since Excel files are not easily diffed. The more I understand your change, the more likely I am to include it.
    b. You may also e-mail me (at the address below) with your suggested changes and I will do my best to incorporate them.
