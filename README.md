* build time and resource costs until everything is maxed out at Town Hall level 10

* complete listing of build and upgrade costs in terms of resources and time

## Contribution Guidelines

At the present time, I have locked the spreadsheet to prevent anyone from creating derivatives with errors. If there is enough interest in improving the spreadsheet further, I will release an unlocked copy. I will also release an unlocked copy if I cease to maintain it.

If you decide to fork this yourself, I request that you adhere to the following:

1. Provide a link to this git page as attribution ([link][gitrepo]).
2. Release your fork under the same license ([CC-BY-SA][CC-BY-SA-full-web]).
3. Properly maintain your fork to keep it up-to-date with the Clash of Clans game.
4. Issue a git pull request to merge your improvements into my version.
  1. Please include a detailed description of your changes since Excel files are not easily diffed. The more I understand your change, the more likely I am to include it.
  2. You may also e-mail me (at the address below) with your suggested changes and I will do my best to incorporate them.
