# Clash of Clans Calculator


## Overview

This project is a spreadsheet that provides a dashboard with numerical insights for Clash of Clans' (COC) players. It guides them as they build their village, upgrade their offensive capabilities, and design armies to loot and defeat their enemies.

**These are some of the metrics and features included:**

* calculate the remaining build time and resource costs to max everything out:
  * at your current Town Hall level, or
  * with everything, including your Town Hall, maxed out
* tweak your army composition based on its cost and build time
* see at a glance:
  * what your next-cheapest upgrade and build is for each resource type
  * which buildings and upgrades are currently available
  * various statistics to help you plan your actions in COC


**Note that some versions of the spreadsheet may contain test data in the fields. To reset the spreadsheet:**

1. In the red box on the "Construction Dashboard" tab marked "Only modify fields in this red box (below)":
   1. Set the "Builder Huts" field to the number of builder huts you have.
   2. Set the "Max" Option field to FALSE.
   3. Set the Barbarian King and Archer Queen levels to their current level (or 0 if their respective altar has not yet been constructed).
   3. Clear all fields in the "Skip these buildings/upgrades in calculations" box.
   4. Clear all values in the columns 1 through 12 for each Building or Upgrade. You can do this by selecting the box, right-clicking, and then selecting "Clear Contents".
2. On the "Army Dashboard" tab:
   1. Clear all of the values in the "Quantities per Attack Set" table (surrounded by a red box).
   2. Change the "Attack Set" field to "LastUsed" or the name of an attack set that you create.
